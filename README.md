AnimateUsingSpringDamping
=========================

Tired of hitting Cmd+R in Xcode each time I wanted to test animateWithDuration:delay:usingSpringWithDamping:initialSpringVelocity:options:animations:completion:, I decided to put an quick app together to get the parameters to at least the right ballpark before I reach for the Run button.

Enjoy!
